# NLP-Jurafsky Notes  

This repository contains concise and easy-to-digest notes on core NLP concepts and jargon, inspired by Dan Jurafsky's *From Language to Information* playlist. Itâ€™s aimed at individuals who already have a solid understanding of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) basics but wish to deepen their understanding of specialized NLP topics.  

## Why This Repository?  
While ML/DL fundamentals like logistic regression and gradient descent are widely discussed, I found certain NLP-specific topics like tokenization algorithms, dialogue systems, and ranked information retrieval to be less straightforward. Watching Jurafsky's lectures helped me connect the dots, particularly around mechanisms like TF-IDF and information retrieval. These notes capture those insights and serve as a reference for understanding the jargon and mechanisms discussed in the course.  

## Whatâ€™s Included?  
- **Core NLP Topics**: Notes on concepts like tokenization algorithms (e.g., unigram, byte pair encoding), dialogue chatbot systems, and ranking methods in information retrieval.  
- **Information Retrieval**: Insights into TF-IDF and ranked retrieval mechanisms, explained in a way that bridges theory and practical understanding.  

## Whatâ€™s Not Included?  
Topics like logistic regression and gradient descent are excluded, as they are foundational concepts covered extensively elsewhere. This repository focuses specifically on the lesser-known or less intuitive aspects of NLP.  

## Who Can Benefit?  
Anyone looking for a quick, structured overview of the *From Language to Information* playlist or seeking clarity on NLP-specific terms and mechanisms. These notes can serve as a refresher or as an entry point for further study.  

## Resource Link  
The notes are inspired by Dan Jurafsky's *From Language to Information* playlist on YouTube. You can access the full playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaZQkZp6WhWyvdiP49JG-rjyTPck_hvEu).  

## Acknowledgments  
The notes are inspired by Dan Jurafsky's incredible course content and my journey in making sense of core NLP topics. I hope this repository helps others in their learning path as well.
