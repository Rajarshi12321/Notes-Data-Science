# Dialog Systems

## **Types of Dialog Systems**

### **Chatbots**
- Chatbots are systems designed to simulate conversation with users. They can be simple (rule-based) or advanced (using machine learning and AI techniques).

### **Task-based Dialog Agents**
- These agents focus on accomplishing specific tasks, such as booking tickets or making reservations, through interactions with users.

## **Chatbot Architecture**

### **Rule-Based Chatbots**
- These chatbots rely on predefined rules to respond to user inputs. They are generally simple and offer a limited range of responses based on keywords or patterns.

### **Corpus-Based Chatbots**
- These chatbots use a large corpus of data (text) to generate responses. The responses are retrieved or generated based on the input, and they can be much more dynamic than rule-based systems.

## **Properties of Human Conversation**

### **Turns**
- Conversations are typically broken down into units called "turns," where each participant speaks one at a time.

### **Turn-Taking Issues**
- **Interruptions**: Occur when one participant speaks over another, leading to potential breakdowns in communication.

## **Implications of Conversational Agents**

### **Barge In**
- Barge-in occurs when the conversational agent starts speaking before the user has finished speaking, potentially disrupting the flow of conversation.

### **End-Pointing**
- This refers to the system’s ability to detect when a conversation has finished, allowing the agent to stop interacting.

### **Speech Acts**
- A speech act is an utterance that performs a function in communication, such as making a request or offering an apology.

### **Grounding: Establishing Common Ground**
- Grounding refers to the process of ensuring mutual understanding between participants in a conversation. It involves continuous confirmation and clarification to maintain context.

### **Adjacency Pairs**
- These are paired exchanges in conversation, where one participant's utterance is naturally followed by a response from the other (e.g., a question followed by an answer).

### **Sub-Dialogs**
- Sub-dialogs are smaller conversations within the main conversation, often used to clarify details or answer specific questions.

### **Correction and Clarification**
- **Correction**: A dialog system may need to correct an earlier mistake.
- **Clarification**: Asking for clarification helps resolve ambiguity in communication.

### **Presequences**
- A sequence that sets the stage for a main dialog action, such as a greeting before a task-based interaction.

## **Eliza and Parry: Early Chatbots**

### **ELIZA**
- **ELIZA** was one of the earliest examples of a chatbot, which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist. It used pattern matching and substitution to engage users in conversation, storing all interactions.

### **Parry**
- **Parry** was a chatbot designed to simulate the behavior of a person with paranoid schizophrenia. It employed more complex methods than ELIZA, including logic to simulate emotions and responses.

## **Corpus-Based Chatbots**

### **Response by Retrieval**
- Corpus-based chatbots retrieve the most relevant response from a pre-defined database or corpus of text. This approach works well for common, repetitive conversations.

### **Response by Generation**
- In contrast, response generation involves creating new responses dynamically, often using machine learning models such as seq2seq or transformer-based models.

## **Frame-Based Dialogue Agents (Task-Based Dialogue Agents)**

### **GUS System**
- The **GUS System** is a task-based dialog agent that uses a frame-based structure to capture the user's goal and preferences, enabling it to perform specific tasks like booking flights or making restaurant reservations.

### **Slot Filling**
- **Slot Filling** refers to the process of extracting key pieces of information from a user’s input. In a task-based system, slots could include things like "departure city," "arrival city," or "date of travel."

### **Rule-Based Slot Filling**
- A rule-based system fills the slots by matching the user's input to predefined templates or patterns.

## **Dialogue-State Architecture**

### **Dialogue Acts**
- **Dialogue acts** are the communicative functions performed by a speaker in a conversation, such as a question, request, or offer.

### **Dialogue State Tracking**
- This involves maintaining the current state of the conversation, which includes remembering previous inputs and actions taken by the system.

### **Dialogue Policy**
- The **dialogue policy** decides the next action the system should take based on the current state of the conversation and predefined rules.

### **Explicit/Implicit Confirmation Strategy**
- **Explicit confirmation** involves directly asking the user for confirmation (e.g., "Do you want to proceed?").
- **Implicit confirmation** is when the system assumes confirmation based on context or previous interactions.

### **Confirmation/Rejection**
- Systems must be able to confirm or reject user inputs based on the context of the conversation, especially when there’s ambiguity or uncertainty.

### **Progressive Prompting for Rejection**
- Progressive prompting involves asking follow-up questions or offering alternatives when the user rejects a suggestion.

## **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**

### **Content Planning**
- The process of determining what information needs to be conveyed in a conversation based on the context and goals.

### **Sentence Realization**
- Involves converting the structured content into grammatically correct and natural-sounding sentences.

### **Delexicalization**
- Delexicalization involves removing specific words or phrases from a sentence and replacing them with placeholders (e.g., using "X" or "Y" instead of specific names or locations).

### **Relexicalization**
- Relexicalization is the process of replacing placeholders with actual words or phrases during sentence generation.

## **Participant Evaluation**

- Evaluating the effectiveness of the dialog system from the perspective of the participants. This could involve measuring user satisfaction, system performance, and the quality of responses.

## **Design and Ethical Issues**

- **Design Issues**: Designing a system that can handle different types of user input, maintain coherence, and effectively achieve its goal.
  
- **Ethical Issues**: Ethical considerations in dialog systems include user privacy, transparency, and ensuring that systems do not perpetuate biases or harm.
